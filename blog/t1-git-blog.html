      Version control software, as the name might suggest, allows you to have multiple versions of your project, and allows you to track changes that were made to your "master" (main branch) over time.  This can be useful to a developer if they are working on a project alone, because they can experiment with code in different "branches" than the master so that if they make mistakes they do not affect the master branch.  It can also allow them to identify the stage at which the mistake was made, so that they do not have to start all the way at the beginning.  But Version Control becomes particularly important for group projects.  Different contributors can work on different "versions" of the project, and can merge those changes into the master when they are done.  This allows developers to avoid the difficulties posed by having multiple collaborators making changes in the same file.

       Git is an example of version control software, and as mentioned above, this means you can track changes.  One way git helps you track changes is via the the "git status" command in the repository that you are working in.  This will identify which changes have been made, and whether or not they have been "staged" to be "committed".  If you decide that want to save the changes you've made, you can first "add" the changes (which stages them) and then "commit" them.  The other way Git can help you track your repository/file is by detailing the commits that have been made to it, via the "git log" command.  This gives you a detailed history of the commits that have been made.

        There are two reasons why you might want to store the code that you have been working on locally on to the cloud via GitHub.  One of them is that by storing it on GitHub, it allows others (contingent upon the permissions you allow) to edit that code and to provide feedback on it.  This collaboration will help improve your code.  The second reason is that it provides some security in the case that something happens to your machine.  If you for some reason needed to get a new machine, you could continue where you left off simply by cloning the work that you had "pushed" to GitHub previously.
