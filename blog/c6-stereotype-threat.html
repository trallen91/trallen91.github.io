  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h2>Cultural Blog #6</h2>
  <h4>June 28, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>Stereotype Threat refers to the phenomenon in which an individual's performance is negatively impacted by the negative stereotypes about his or her social group; the anxiety about confirming those negative stereotypes prevents optimal performance.
    </p>
    <p> My "social identity" is that of a young white male, and I therefore believe that I have not been subject to the same type of stereotype threat that other groups may be.  There are not many fields in which a young white male is told (by society) that they are not capable of exceling.  I can therefore only really sympathize with other groups that regularly have to deal with this type of stereotyping.  I do feel, though, that I have had some peripheral exposure to stereotype threat due to relationships I have with people who have exerpeienced it directly. </p>
    <p> The world of programming is fraught with stereotype threat.  It is certainly a male-dominated field and the pervasive opinion in society is that men are better at math-related disciplines.  This has manifested itself in subtle ways in my life, especially in the work place.  I have had a number of female colleagues who have been terrified of touching an excel spreadsheet for fear of ruining the logic in some of the formulas.  I cannot speak on their behalf and say for certain that it was the stereotype threat that was acting as a hindrance, but I certainly feel that it was a "stereotype boost" that lead me to learn how to "program" in Excel.  Like my female colleagues, I was initially intimidated by the formulas and (apparent) complexities of an Excel spreadsheet.  Despite this, I was comforted by the belief of "there is no reason why I should not be able to do this."  I think that's the fundamental difference -- females cannot access this comforting thought as easily. </p>
    <p> I will continue to be aware of how Stereotype Threat can affect others, and do what I can to help overcome it.  This will include making females (and other social groups that may be subject to stereotype threat) feel more comfortable in the environment so that they are not intimidated by it. </p>
