     Shereef's analogy of the "Restaurant" vs the "Kitchen" mindset for DBC resonates particularly with me because I already find myself falling into some of the trappings of a "Restaurant" mindset.  When you pay a substantial amount of money, I think there's a natural tendency to view it as an investment and to start to consider how you are going to get that money back -- i.e. finding a job as soon as possible.  The danger of doing so is that "learning to code" becomes a means to a (monetary) end, rather than an end in and of itself.  When I first decided to do the program it was because I wanted to be stimulated intellectually, and that will not happen if I have the mentality of "I paid X amount of dollars, I need to get through this program in order to start making money back again", which I believe to be the Restaurant mentality.

       A friend of mine made a similar analogy about learning how to program: do not treat learning how to code like many people treat buying a treadmill for their house.  What he meant was, do not spend money just so that you essentially guilt yourself into doing something that you want/need to do.  The motivation has to be internal and fundamental, and spending money on it should only be seen as a way to reach your fundamental goal.

        I will have to make an effort to remember the message behind both of these analogies, because it is certainly tempting to fall into the traps of bad mindsets.  I will continue to be cognizant of this throughout my experience at DBC.
