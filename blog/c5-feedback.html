  <h1>Pairing and Feedback</h1>

    One of the advantages of DBC is that it is structured so that you pair with others and can get feedback on your pairing.  I will talk about my pairing experience thus far, as well as some of the feedback that I have received.

    <p>Pairing to solve challenges is a pretty new concept for me.  I have historically been much more inclined to work things on my own so as to minimize distractions.  I'm happy that I am being forced to pair because I think it introduces me to how problems are solved in the real world.  Overall, it has been a good experience because I have a had a chance to learn from other people, and getting a chance to teach others about something you have learned definitely helps solidify concepts.  It has been frustrating at times when the pair wants to handle the challenge in a way completely differently than I do, but I realize that that is how things will often occur in my career and I have to learn how to get used to it and use it my advantage.</p>
    <p> Receiving feedback has also been a good part of this process.  It is good to hear when others like working with me, and also informative when I am given something that I need to improve on.  I probably do not seek out feedback enough in my own life, so hopefully this experience will encourage me to request it, as it clearly has helped me evolve as a programmer in just a couple of weeks.</p>
