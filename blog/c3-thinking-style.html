     My personal thinking style, according to this quiz, is that of a "Concrete Sequential Thinker".  I should note that I tend to question the validity of any quiz that purports to tell you about very complex aspects of your character based on your answers, but for the purposes of this exercise I will assume that I am in fact a "Concrete Sequential Thinker".
    </p>
    <p> A Concrete Sequential Thinker tends to see things in a very linear and logical manner.  I think that this will help me in a lot of ways, because programming at its essence is as logical as possible.  A computer is an extremely logical "being" that doesn't have very strong powers of interpretation.  They read instructions in a very linear way, and I think having a mindset that parallels that of a computer will help me write concise instructions to that computer. </p>
    <p> Perhaps one of the setbacks of this mentality is the lack of experimentation.  I do find that when I come across problems involving concepts with which I am unfamiliar, I tend to blank out rather than finding more innovative ways to attack the problem.  This is something that I will have to expand as a I move forward, because there is certainly an element of creativity to programming. </p>
